# Collatz Conjecture Calculator (CCC)

The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1.

The program was made for educational purposes and to improve my Python programming knowledge.
On running, you input an integer and the program applies the Collatz function until the number `1` is reached. It also shows a graph for all the values that were obtained.
